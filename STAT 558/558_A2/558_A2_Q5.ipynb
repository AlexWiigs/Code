    "The effect of five different ingredients $(A,B,C,D,E)$ on reaction time of a chemical process is being studied. Each batch of new material is only large enough to permit five runs to be made. Furthermore, each run requires approximately 1 1/2 hours, so only five runs can be made in one day. The experimenter decides to run the experiment as a Latin square so that day and batch effects can be systematically controlled. She obtains the data the follow. Analyze the data from this experiment (use $\\alpha = 0.05$) and draw conclusions."
